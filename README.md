# my-obsidian-setup
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a the best note taking application I found.
It is open source and takes data ownership very seriously. It is also very flexible.
Its like VSCode for note taking. You can customize absolutely everything with a rich
extension library. This is my configuration of it. I hope you enjoy it. I left some sample
folders and files to demo how i organize my vault.
