## Installing one drive on work machine with security firewall

Problem:
I was not able to install any cloud sync software. one drive(personal), dropbox, etc.

Fix:
I tried to install sync.com desktop app which asked me to enable 3rd party SSL certificates. That's what fixed it. Now I was able to install one drive personal.
